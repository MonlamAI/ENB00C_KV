A Brief Prayer to the Precious Master Padmākara to Swiftly Fulfill Wishes and Dispel Obstacles OṂ ĀḤ HŪṂ VAJRA GURU PADMA SIDDHI HŪṂ Embodiment of all sources of refuge, Orgyen Rinpoche, To you we pray with a yearning so strong it is hard to bear. Dispel into space all obstacles-outer, inner, and secret- And grant your blessing so that all our aims and wishes may be fulfilled in accord with the Dharma. With single-minded devotion, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo composed this prayer, which arose quite spontaneously on its own. May there be virtue!
